# Discussion with the professor about Fourth Assignment 

##### 1. Professor 
About searching on EST in both JSP and RCPSP, you wrote:

"This is because it may take us in the wrong direction within the search tree, and if the search space is complex, it would take too long to find a global optimum."  

"This is because this type of search may lead us in the wrong direction within the search tree, going to complicate things for finding a solution." 

These are not specific arguments. Is searching on EST a good strategy to find an initial solution? What happens when searching for the optimal solution? Why is it inefficient to find the optimal solution? These are the things we discussed when we motivated the schedule or postpone search strategy.
